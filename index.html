	<h2>What is Brisket? </h2>
		<p>Brisket comes from the chest of a animal. As consumers,
			we usually get our Brisket meat from cows. Beef Brisket 
			is a working muscle of the cow, giving it a tough mouthfeel
			when cooked the wrong way.
		</p>
	<h2>How do we cook Brisket</h2>
		<p>There are many ways you can cook a brisket such as
			in the oven or in the smoker. The most commonly known
			way to cook Brisket is with a smoker.
		</p>
	<h2>Cooking Machines</h2>
		<p>Any time of smoker will work. Common ones are electric,
			pellets, and offset. Find what works best for you.
		</p>

	<h2>How to Pick Brisket at the Store</h2>
		<p>
		   Picking a Brisket is one of the most important steps to bbq.
		   Small details such as shape, bend test, and grades add up. Paying 
		   attention to the small details in everything set you apart
		   from your competition.
		</p>
			<h3>The Grades of Brisket</h3>
				<p>
					There are many other grades of brisket, but for simplicity,
					I will only talk about the commonly used grades often found
					at your nearest supermarket.

				</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Prime</li>
				<li>Choice</li>
				<li>Select</li>
				<li>Unmarked</li>
			</ul>
				
			<h3>Visible Fat</h3>
				<p>
					Purchasing a Brisket that contains too much fat produces
					less of that meat you are looking for. A fatty Brisket will require 
					a large trim in order to cook properly on the smoker. A good tip for 
					limiting the fat would be the bend test. If you can bend your Brisket
					from one end to another, your Brisket passes the bend test. 
		
				</p>
			<h3>The Shape</h3>
				<p>What we are looking for is a oval shape, that is the same
				   thickness on both ends. Brisket is often uneven, having a thinner
				   flat which can dry out the meat when cooking.
				</p>

	<h3>Trimming Your Brisket</h3>
		<p>
			You're most likely wondering why you need to <span class= "shadow"><em>trim 
			a brisket before</em></span> you cook it.
